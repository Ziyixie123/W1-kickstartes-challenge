# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project: use excel to analyze the relationship between the outcome and release date, and outcome with the goal  

### Purpose 
Be familiar with filter, pivot table, and essential functions of Excel. 
For the Kickstarter project, Try to identify any possible relationship between the outcome and the projects' release date.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
From the graph, we can see that the filed line was closed to a flat line. meaning that if the theater's bad outcome is not related to when it will launch 
On the other hand, successful outcome of theater concentrate in the May and June


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
A theater with the goal of less than 1000, around 35000 to 45000 or about more than 50000, has the biggest chance to be successful
At the same time. theaters with the goal of around 30000, 45000 to 50000 have the highest chance to failed 
Theaters projects are unlikely to be canceled 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I spent more time than I thought on the pivot table 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on the Launch Date?
1.From the chart, it can be assumed that the theater projects have the best chance to be successful if they launch in May to June, and probably it is because it is summertime and people, mostly students, have much more free time 
2. There is no relation between launch time and theater projects failure 


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A theater with the goal of less than 1000, around 35000 to 45000 or around more than 50000, has the biggest chance to be successful

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
you can find out the relations, but you cannot find out the causation between two data sets 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
tables: outcome_and_country, outcomes, and pledges 
chart: pie chart of successful, failed, canceled theater projects in the US
